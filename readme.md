# User Story
As a traveler, I want to be able to research the exchange rate of the countries I'm planning on visiting; The United States, Canada, Europe, and the UK. When I use the application, I want to be able to choose the country I'm exchanging the currency from and the currency I'm exchanging to. I want to be able to input any amount of currency and see the equivalent value of the foreign currency.
